# Simple Command-Line Journal

A basic journaling application that allows you to write and read daily journal entries. The first program I've made with Python.

## Features

- Write journal entries
- Read previous journal entries
- Simple command-line interface
- Automatic date and time stamping
- Entries stored in a plain text file

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages required (uses only Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the `journal.py` file
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system

## Usage

To start the journal application, run:

```bash
python journal.py
```

## File Storage

Journal entries are stored in `journal.txt` in the same directory as the script. Each entry includes:
- Date stamp
- Entry text
- Blank line separator
